# Getting Started with the REST API
There are basically four types of methods used here.

1.) GET - The GET method is used to retrieve data from the server.

2.) POST - The POST method sends data to the server and creates a new resource.

3.) PATCH - The PATCH method modifies an existing resource.

4.) DELETE - The DELETE method is used to delete a resource specified by its URI.
