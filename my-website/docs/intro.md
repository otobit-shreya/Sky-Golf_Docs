# Introduction

Let's discover **SkyGolf in less than 5 minutes**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Installation of packages

Clone the project from the github into your-folder.

After cloning the project run the following command

```bash
npm install
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd your-folder
npm run dev
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run dev` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at ```http://localhost:4000/```
